            Knowing what keywords to use on both the backend and the customer-facing
            copy of your listing gives your product a necessary boost above the
            competition. We will gather information on the competitiveness and search
            volume of keyword terms specific to your company to provide the foundation
            of a listing that ranks high in search results and lands directly in front of
            your target customer.

        <p class="L9-para L9-text-right">
            There is a formula and strategy to crafting a title that will properly index your product
            and bring it to your target customer’s attention. We understand what the algorithm
            wants from a title and will fine-tune your title to rank higher in search results,
            while maintaining the straightforward readability that advances conversions.

            Combating swathes of generic listings and shrinking attention spans, well-crafted
            bullet points are often the difference between an idle listing and a sale. This space is
            also keyword-indexed, so seamless incorporation that does not interfere with the customer’s

            This is the first place Amazon looks to for keywords that help it index, categorize,
            and rank your listings in the search results. We will maximize the limited
            space that Amazon allows with only the most applicable and profitable
            keywords. You won’t waste any time on trial-and-error, and will enjoy immediate

                Once you’re in FBA, we can expand you through the Amazon network of
                marketplaces in 13 different countries, vastly increasing your customer base
                in a move that can skyrocket sales. If you’re outside of the US, we’ll introduce
                your product into the US market, whose sales volume is legions above any
                other country. No matter which way you approach it, going international is
                an incredible business opportunity. We’ll take care of the logistics of international
                compliance so you can simply enjoy the increase in sales.
